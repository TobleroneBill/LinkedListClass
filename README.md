# Linked List Class

Uploaded all files using Git Bash (not hard just has a learning curve), so I am really happy lol

This is a C++ class of my own implementations of Linked Lists. These are pretty fun to work with in terms of logical puzzles, but they definitely are draining on my life force.

Contains a class for a string list, and an int list. Wanted to use as few libraries as possible, but for the strings I felt like there was no other way than to use regex and standard string classes.

There is also probably many avenues for refactoring, making it more elegant, and also Improving performance. Also unsure of how memory safe this is, so I think I will go back to that aspect at some point, becasue thats alot more important to me than getting the perfect solution (but it is quite funny to ignore imo LOLOLOL)
